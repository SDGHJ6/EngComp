# Engineering Computations

A sophomore course in Engineering Computations at the George Washington University, Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering department. 
The local course number is [MAE 2117](http://bulletin.gwu.edu/search/?P=MAE%202117). 

This is a full course re-write for Fall 2017, by Prof. Lorena A. Barba and doctoral student Natalia C. Clementi.

The course consists of a set of somewhat self-contained Modules, addressing an area of application or skills in computing.
Each module is made up of four or five lessons, written as a Jupyter notebook.
We use Python as the programming language.

## Course Philosophy
We take inspiration in the ideas of [Seymour Papert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seymour_Papert) about computational thinking.
In particular, we want to design a course that adheres to Papert's _Power Principle_:

> What comes first, "using" or "understanding"? The natural mode of learning is to first use, leading slowly to understanding. New ideas are a source of power to _do something_.

## Course Modules
